# Ordered Selector for HTML

## Motivation

The original HTML select/option can only allowed the developers to get the final value using JavaScript, which means that the selected order is not affecting. So, this small code is for listing out the selected order for \<select\> in HTML.

## Run

Just open `index.html` in your web browser.
